D3 (on my website)
- demo: http://jdeboi.com/2013/06/26/louisiana-brew-sort-3-way-partition-quick-sort/
- start your web server (MAMP?)
- all the necessary files are in the brewSortD3 folder
- open quickSort.html in your web browser

Processing
- open brewSort.pde to start a visualization
- the Quicksort object creates a log for the algorithm - the positions and colors of each beer object are printed at each step in the algorithm so that the steps can be replayed using a csv/text file
- After the Quicksort object is instantiated, it's possible to step through the algorithm by pressing 'n'
- to reset the beers[] array, press 'r'
